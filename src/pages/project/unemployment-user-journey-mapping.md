## Overview

The [Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/executive-office-of-labor-and-workforce-development) (LWD) and the [Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/digital-services) initiated a cross-secretariat joint effort to take a human-centered approach to improve the constituents interactions with the state's unemployment services. Collaborated with the executive leadership at LWD and boots-on-the ground service workers at [Department of Unemployment Assistance](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-unemployment-assistance) (DUA) and [MassHire Department of Career Services](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/masshire-department-of-career-services) (MDCS), our team mapped out the end-to-end user journey for unemployed residents and jobseekers in Massachusetts — from the moment of losing their job to receiving the first unemployment check, maintaining weekly eligibility, and getting re-employed.

## Background

There were few organizational challenges that we faced with: 

1. The organization was dependent on a suite of outdated digital and analog tools that compromised its ability to deliver critical unemployment and career services.

2. Widespread burnout and low job satisfaction among overworked, under-supported DUA employees caused an increasingly high turnover rate.

3. Changes in labor markets and technology mean that more and more people would need career assistance and retraining. 

In order to address these challenges holistically, we must first understand the needs of both the constituents and the state employees providing the services.

## Research

First step to get to understand the needs of our users was to get some preliminary data from our users directly. We designed a survey and sent it out to \~25,000 people who had applied for unemployment insurance (UI) within the last year and received \~1,300 responses. The responses provided an aggregate (quantitative) view of our users about their behaviors, experiences and demographics, which helped us create meaningful segments and informed our persona creation. 

To develop a deeper understanding and empathy for our users, we conducted multi-faceted qualitative research, which happened in person with different groups of users in different environments:

\- We recruited and interviewed business owners in Massachusetts about their experiences with DUA services

\- We spoke to DUA and MDCS employees to gain a first-hand understanding of what it’s like to work in the organization

\- We spent a day at Franklin-Hampshire Career Center in Greenfield and a day at Fall River Career Center, as well as half a day at the DUA Walk-In Center in Boston. We sat in career seminars, observed how the career services users navigated the resources, most importantly, talked to 46 people about their experiences with UI and career services.

These interviews provided us with an all-around view of the process from combined human perspectives. The people we spoke to spanned all ages, industries, and demographics, provided us personal accounts of various experiences. 

## Synthesis and Ideation

User journey mapping focuses on the user’s own experience. It seeks to get at the emotions that people go through, the tools that they use, and the people they interact with on their journey. 

With all of this material, we went back to the office and started to synthesize what we heard into key themes and insights. For example, one recurring comment that emerged in multiple interviews was that workers believe that if they pay into the system throughout their working life, they should be allowed to access benefits when they need them. Others spoke of the uncertainty of wading through lots of conditions and clauses, and being confused as to what would or would not affect their eligibility or payments.

Altogether, the themes allowed us to build 6 personas. Personas are based on research and represent different segments of users, and help you think about solutions specifically for those users. Our personas were defined by their age, primary language, previous experience with UI, and how tech-savvy and proactive they were.

We took these personas into the concept sprint, an intensive ideation workshop. Over the course of 4 days, our group delved into the personas, charted their journeys, and generated many ideas for how to reduce the pain points they were encountering. We ultimately landed on 3 main concepts (or ideal solutions): improvements to the UI platform to help people apply for UI and navigate the process more easily; a one-stop-shop for jobseekers to receive training and job opportunities that match their specific profiles; and local fairs aimed at strengthening professional networks within communities.

**Crafting Personas**

We used our key insights and interviews to craft personas to represent the various perspectives and experiences of DUA's employees and constituents.

**Concept Sprint & Current State Journey Mapping** 

For our concept sprint, the Digital Team reunited with members of DUA senior management and line staff to review and process key insights from our research, create a journey map of their current experience as DUA employees, and brainstorm organizational improvements in small groups.

***"How might we..."***

*"...improve communications from upper management so that employees understand the context for decisions and have information to do their jobs?"*

*"...use the expertise and experience of staff to make DUA a great and effective place to work?"*

*"...promote openness and trust so that DUA employees are excited to come to work everyday?"*  

**Brainstorming Solutions** 

After the concept sprint, the Digital Team and the project team from DUA came together to review the ideas that came out of the sprint. We selected minimally viable ideas that could give us quick wins as well as ideas that could be implemented over the course of multiple quarters.

We presented our solutions to the entire senior management suite of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

**Next Steps**

This project is on ongoing collaboration between The Mass Digital Service and The Department of Unemployment Assistance and The Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Next Steps include implementing MVPs of projects of interest for usability testing and refinement.



We prototyped, tested, and are about to release some quick wins to help users, such as [online calculators](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/working-part-time-while-receiving-unemployment-benefits) to help them figure out their benefits and [a short pamphlet to guide them through the first steps](http://mass.gov/guides/what-to-do-if-youve-become-unemployed-in-massachusetts) they need to take to find a new career opportunity.
