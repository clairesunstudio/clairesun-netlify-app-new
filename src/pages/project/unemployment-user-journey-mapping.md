Our research approach aimed to gather both an aggregate (quantitative) and subjective (qualitative) view of our users. So we began by sending a survey to 25,000 people who had applied for UI within the last year. We received a solid 1,300 responses -- a 5 percent response rate. One of the most interesting findings was that satisfaction with UI Online --the online tool that people can use to file for benefits -- is positively correlated with age. Our hypothesis there is that younger claimants who are more tech-savvy are less satisfied with UI Online because they have higher expectations for how a modern website or application should perform. There are plenty more insights and we are still in the process of mining this data.

The heart of our research, however, happened in person. We spent a day at Franklin-Hampshire Career Center in Greenfield and a day at Fall River Career Center, as well as half a day at the DUA Walk-In Center in Boston. We spoke to staff, sat in 2 career seminars, observed the spaces and resources that users have to navigate and, most importantly, talked to 46 people about their experiences with UI and career services.
