## Overview

The [Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/executive-office-of-labor-and-workforce-development) (LWD) and the [Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/digital-services) initiated a cross-secretariat joint effort to take a human-centered approach to improve the constituents interactions with the state's unemployment services. Collaborated with the executive leadership at LWD and boots-on-the ground service workers at [Department of Unemployment Assistance](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-unemployment-assistance) (DUA) and [MassHire Department of Career Services](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/masshire-department-of-career-services) (MDCS), our team mapped out the end-to-end user journey for unemployed residents and jobseekers in Massachusetts — from the moment of losing their job to receiving the first unemployment check, maintaining weekly eligibility, and getting re-employed.

## Background

There were few organizational challenges that we faced with: 

1. The organization was dependent on a suite of outdated digital and analog tools that compromised its ability to deliver critical unemployment and career services.

2. Widespread burnout and low job satisfaction among overworked, under-supported DUA employees caused an increasingly high turnover rate.

3. Changes in labor markets and technology mean that more and more people would need career assistance and retraining. 

In order to address these challenges holistically, we must first understand the needs of both the constituents and the state employees providing the services.

## Process

User journey mapping focuses on the user’s own experience. It seeks to get at the emotions that people go through, the tools that they use, and the people they interact with on their journey.

Our research approach aimed to gather both an aggregate (quantitative) and subjective (qualitative) view of our users. So we began by sending a survey to 25,000 people who had applied for UI within the last year. We received a solid 1,300 responses -- a 5 percent response rate. One of the most interesting findings was that satisfaction with UI Online --the online tool that people can use to file for benefits -- is positively correlated with age. Our hypothesis there is that younger claimants who are more tech-savvy are less satisfied with UI Online because they have higher expectations for how a modern website or application should perform. There are plenty more insights and we are still in the process of mining this data.

The heart of our research, however, happened in person. We spent a day at Franklin-Hampshire Career Center in Greenfield and a day at Fall River Career Center, as well as half a day at the DUA Walk-In Center in Boston. We spoke to staff, sat in 2 career seminars, observed the spaces and resources that users have to navigate and, most importantly, talked to 46 people about their experiences with UI and career services.
