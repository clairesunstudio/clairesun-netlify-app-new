## Overview

Working closely with the Department of Public Health (DPH) and the data team on visualizing the statistics of opioid usage in Massachusetts and created an interactive data story to engage the public on this subject. I played a key role in the end-to-end delivery of this project, including concept sketching, data visualization, UI design, prototyping, website development and deployment, user testing, accessibility testing, etc.
