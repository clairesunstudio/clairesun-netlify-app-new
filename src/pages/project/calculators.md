## Overview
Mass Digital Team was enlisted to help stand up a digital team for the newly created Department of Family and Medical Leave (the department) to achieve their vision of creating the first digitally native constituents-facing service in Massachusetts, meaning no brick and mortar service centers — all services are provided online, supplemented by a call center.

## Background
In 2018, a legislation has passed to allow Massachusetts workers to take paid leaves beginning in January 2021. The department was tasked with an incredible challenge to go from zero to fully operational in 2 years to service the 3.7 million workers and 225,000 employers in Massachusetts. 

## My Roles
I started on the project since the PFML law was in draft mode. More than a year ahead of the benefits start date, employers were required to collect and remit contributions to the department starting October 2019. In order to help employers in Massachusetts understand and comply with the law, I collaborated with the department to design and develop two calculators — [one for employers to interpret the contribution requirements](https://calculator.digital.mass.gov/pfml/contribution) and [one for workers to estimate their benefits](https://calculator.digital.mass.gov/pfml/yourbenefits/).  Rounds of iterations and refinements were made to the calculation logic and language as I worked closely with the business owners and the legal team to interpret the law. Concurrently, I ran moderated testing on both calculators and solicited feedback from payroll managers, business owners, employees and self-employed workers, which drove the final business decision making. 
... to be continued.
