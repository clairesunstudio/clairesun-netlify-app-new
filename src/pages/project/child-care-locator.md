## Overview
The Digital Services Team at the Executive Office of Technology Security and Services (EOTSS) in partnership with the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) seeks to provide services to develop the front-end of the child care consumer search application in alignment with requirements laid out in the reauthorization of the CCDBG Act. The purpose of this online tool is to help parents make informed choices about child care services and to encourage child care providers to improve the quality of their services. The three target audiences of the application are parents, child care providers and the general public.


## My Roles
The timeline to meet the federal requirements was aggressive — in 10 days, we built a fully working prototype in Gatsby 2 with our react component library (Mayflower React) leveraging Google Maps Javascript API and Geocoding API to power the map and address search. We also designed and built custom API to power child care search and provider details pages using S3 — postgres — Lambda — API gateway architecture to allow us to query childcare programs by radius, filter by provider type, etc. and build static pages with detail information about each program.
