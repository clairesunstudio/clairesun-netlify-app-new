## Overview

The MassHire Department of Career Services (MassHire) came to us for a design consulting service on a new initiative that would allow jobseekers to access all the state workforce services in one place. A development team had being hired to build the digital tool, but the MassHire management team needed help to draft design requirements, and provide design guidance to the vendor team to ensure the final product will meet the users needs and be easy to use.

## Background

Most of the state's career and unemployment services already had its own system, and these systems were built in silos. For example, in order for an unemployment to be qualified for their benefits, they were required to look. 

The business goals and success metrics
