## Overview

I worked on design and development of the data story, with the data and GIS team on the first-hand data from the rideshare companies on how Massachusetts residents use rideshare services, through exploratory and confirmatory data analysis, combining correlated datasets and data visualizations we highlight the important information and trends and making large data sets easy to consume for the public.

## My Roles

In August 2016, Governor Baker signed legislation related to ridesharing companies, also known as transportation network companies (TNCs). Part of that legislation helped Massachusetts start collecting data about ridesharing service from TNCs.
