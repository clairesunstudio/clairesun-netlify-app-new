## Background

In August 2016, Governor Baker signed legislation related to ridesharing companies, also known as transportation network companies (TNCs). Part of that legislation enabled Massachusetts Department of Utilities start collecting data on the innerstate and interstate rideshare patterns, in order to inform public transportation and other policy decisions for the Commonwealth.

## My Roles

As the designer and developer on this project, I collaborated with the data and GIS team on turning the first-hand data provided by the rideshare companies into an interactive data visualization showing how Massachusetts residents use rideshare services. Through exploratory and confirmatory data analysis, combining correlated datasets, and data visualization, we were able to highlight the important information and patterns and present large datasets in a way that was easy for the general public to consume and understand.
