## Overview

The Bright & Beautiful (有灵且美) is a non-profit organization that was created to bring art and mindfulness to the “left-behind” girls in rural China, aiming to help unlock their creative potentials and empower them to achieve their dreams. Between 2014 and 2017, the team had successfully hosted more than 6 summer and winter arts camps and other creative workshops partnering with local schools in rural areas, served over 400 girls, and connected more than 50 volunteers from around the globe.

<small>As part of the promotional campaign for the arts camps on Indigogo and Kickstarter, I created this parallax scrolling site, to support volunteer recruitment and fundraising for the summer arts camp, which was later hosted in Yunnan China in 2015.</small>

## My role

Sharing the same passion and goal, I joined the team at its early ideation stage, and helped form the organizational vision and the operational strategy from the start. During my time with the team, I established our visual brand, created campaign materials, e-commerce sites, promotional landing pages and was driving the creative directions. I continued doing pro bono creative consulting work two years after the team relocated to China. "Write Her a Postcard" and the "Story-T" are two of the events/products which I helped plan and create.

## Story-T

From hosting the summer camps in rural Yunnan, China, we connected with a group of talented young women embroiderers who were crafting amazing artwork that were extremely undervalued. We hand picked over 200 pieces of embroideries from their creation and sewed them onto T-shirts, with a QR code on the back linking to their own personal stories and dreams. This idea was a hit on social media and at our offline events and the story-Ts were sold out soon after. All profits were given back to each embroiderer to help them with buying textbooks and pursuing their dreams.

## Write her a postcard

In conjunction with the Story-T, I illustrated and designed a set of postcards. One full set was in exchange for a free one for someone to write to one of the young embroidery workers — the protagonists in the Story-T stories.  We collected close to 100 written postcards filled with kind words and encouragements which had brightened up or could have later changed their life.

## Arts Camps

Collaborated with [the Pulsera Project](https://www.pulseraproject.org/), we brought the handcrafted bracelets to the first-ever Bright & Beautiful summer camp to girls in Guizhou, China, combining the two good causes together.  This project built a bridge between these girls in the villages and the outside world, and reminded them that all of us are a irreplaceable part of the global community.
