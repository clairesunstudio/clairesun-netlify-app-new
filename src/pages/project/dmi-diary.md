## Overview

“My DMI Diary” is a responsive website that I have designed to document my work and experience at the Dynamic Media Institute (DMI). This diary pays tribute to the year-long program by documenting the courses which I have taken, such as Design As Experience, Elements of Media, Information Architecture, Web Design, Advanced Web Project, Design Symposium and Sensor Technology for Interactive Environments at the MIT Media Lab.

## My Roles

"The Dynamic Media Institute at MassArt is an MFA program that investigates interactive design, data visualization, sound and video installation, small objects, big data and much more. My peers are fine artists, designers, architects, engineers, programmers, and educators, among others, who pursue a unique thesis vision through a rigorous practice of research, prototyping, and writing."
