## Overview

The concept of the Facebook Fan is a play on the puns of "fan" and "cool", that lets you experience the "coolness" based on the fan counts on any given Facebook page. It's designed and prototyped with the Facebook Graph API, an Arduino, a rotor, a power supply, and a box fan, held together by laser-cut plexiglass casing. By entering a Facebook Page by its name or ID, you can enjoy the cooling sensation "powered" by that social media account's popularity. You can also compare the cooling effects by different accounts. The device turns stats instantly into a multi-sensory experience that allows you not only visualize but feel the effect, translating the impression of "cool" into a tangible sensation.

## Inspirations

“Useless” and “machine” are inherently a pair of contrary concepts. Influential artist, designer and innovator Bruno Munari first married these two words together by calling his inventions the “useless machine”. Although they were functionally “useless”, they were not without a purpose. His work was intended to “re-establish the long-lost contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing.”

As designers, we are trained in design thinking, programmed to design for usability, functionality and efficiency. Centering around consumer needs and catering to the market interest have become our natural instincts. The Facebook Fan is taking a step back from the notion of design. Its functionality is excessive, however it provides some food for thoughts on the underlying social values and judgement systems in this social media era.
