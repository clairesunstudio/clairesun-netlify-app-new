## Overview

Heavily inspired by Mike Bostock's visualization of the 2014 fall fashion week. I recreated a similar concept prototype using CSS and plain Javascript without D3. Taking screenshots of movie scenes from the Alfred Hitchcock movies, I assembled a working prototype that allows users to visualize the female fashion color palettes in Hitchcock's movies. This prototype also explores the opportunies connecting the fashion wore by leading ladies like Grace Kelly, Tippi Hedren, Janet Leigh, Joan Fontaine, Kim Novak to social media for sharing and recreating the outfits from classic movies.
