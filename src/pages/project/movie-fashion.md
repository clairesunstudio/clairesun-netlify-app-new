## Overview

Heavily inspired by Mike Bostock's data visualization [Front Row to Fashion Week](https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/02/14/fashion-week-editors-picks/index.html), I created a prototype using CSS and plain Javascript (without the use of D3) as a personal project, featuring the outfits wore by the 7 leading ladies — Grace Kelly, Tippi Hedren, Janet Leigh, Joan Fontaine, Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint, and Ingrid Bergman — in Alfred Hitchcock's movies.

After programmatically capturing the scenes from Hitchcock's movies, I built a working prototype that would allow the users to visualize the female leads' fashion and color palettes in the movies, borrowing from Bostock's visualization technique. This exercise was an exploration of my ideas to recreate the outfits from classic movies leveraging the crowdsourcing power of social media.
