## Overview

Exhibited at the Boston CyberArts Gallery at the Fresh Media Art Show, "Artificial Bioluminescence" was an art installation came from my final project for the sensor and environment class at the MIT Media Lab. I recreated my personal experiences with bioluminescence organisms using Arduinos, LEDs, light and sound sensor to greatly impress the natural ambiance in a city setting. My skills crossing the disciplines of the art and technology, enabled me to conceptualize the design, devise the sensors, program the algorithm, leading up to the final fabrication, testing, and setup. The exhibition consists of two parts: Firelies and Dinoflagellates.


## Part I: LED Fireflies

## Part II: LED Dinoflagellates

This piece consists of a LED installation constructed in two parts: In one part, about 60 to 100 LEDs are flickering simulating the fireflies. Sound and light sensors control the lightness of these “fireflies”. The second part of the installation consists of a water tank and approximately 15 LEDs that are floating on the water and producing the effect of the bioluminescence. The floating lights respong to movement, so that they light up when people stir the water. Also, as the people pick out the LEDs with hand, the lights fade away. Both of the pieces were installed in a dark space, in order to extentuate the lighting effect, and to greatly impress the natural ambience on the users.

## Inspirations

Bioluminescence never failed to fascinate me – whether it’s a firefly twinkling between the bushes on a dark night or a unicellular organism that glittering in the water from any movements. It is a phenomenon that puzzled many scientists and unreplicable by modern technology.  

Growing up in a major city in China, I rarely got to see fireflies in a natural environment. I remember attending this event hosted by the city many years ago, where thousands of fireflies were transported from a different area to be set free in a park for the public to see. The event did not turn out well — all I could see were bright flashes coming from cellphone cameras, as the fireflies were too scared to light up or fly away by the large crowd, dense noises and strong camera flashes.

Fast forward a few years, I had a magical experience seeing and interacting with the "glowing water" off the coast of Puerto Rico. As I swept my hand into the water, countless of tiny single-celled creatures called dinoflagellates would light up the surrounding water. 

These personal experiences inspired me to create this installation art. The intention of this art was not to match the experiences I had, but a reminder for the viewers to appreciate and be mindful of the beauty of the nature and don't let these bio lights fade away in the process of technologization.
