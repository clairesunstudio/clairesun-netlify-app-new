## Background

The YES team is made up of eight state and federal agencies that coordinate efforts to protect and promote the health and safety of young workers across the Commonwealth. The Digital Services team worked with the YES team and created this original campaign.

## Overview

As the designer on this project, I worked with the Digital Services project team to brainstorm and originate the campaign ideas around “Getting hurt is not in your job description”. I staged and photographed the scenarios according to my sketches, and throughout post production designed and turned the photographs into final marketing campaign visuals.

## Impact

During the 3 week campaign run time, Facebook and Instagram ad campaign drove 38,000 clicks to the YES campaign website. The Facebook ad campaign had the record low per click for a state government campaign at $0.12 per click. The average cost per click for this type of campaign is $0.64.
