## Background

The Youth Employment and Safety (YES) team is made up of eight state and federal agencies that coordinate efforts to protect and promote the health and safety of young workers across the Commonwealth. We worked with the YES team to help them deliver an engaging campaign to raise awareness of youth rights and to promote the state services and information that the team put out. The campaign was publicized on the state government social media accounts, and across the state billboards and signages.

## Overview

As the sole designer on this project, I worked with the team to brainstorm concepts and landed on the tagline — “getting hurt is not in your job description” (a pullback from the original hashtag #NotYourJob that was not approved). I sketched out six scenarios that can be staged inside our building to be used as campaign visuals. Alongside another photographer, I staged and photographed the scenarios based on the sketches, and turned the raw photographs into final graphics as omni-channel marketing materials.

## Impact

During the 3-week social media campaign runtime, Facebook and Instagram ad campaign drove 38,000 clicks to the YES campaign website. The Facebook ad campaign had the record low per click for a state government campaign at $0.12 per click. The average cost per click for this type of campaign is $0.64.
