  blurb: >
    I wear many hats in various projects — conducting user research and
    usability testing, gathering business requirements and translating them into
    design, front-end development and code review, creating data stories,
    analyzing web usage data and sometimes venturing into product management.
    I'm the Design System Lead for Mayflower at Mass Digital.
