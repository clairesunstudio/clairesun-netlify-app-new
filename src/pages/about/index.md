  blurb: >
    I wear many hats in various projects — conducting user research, translating
    requirements into wireframes, writing and reviewing code, creating data
    visualizations and venturing into data analytics. I&apos;m the Product Owner
    of the Commonwealth Design System and I sometimes PM technical projects.
